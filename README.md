## Inspiration

The inspiration for this website came from the Instagram page [PositivityDaily1](https://www.instagram.com/positivitydaily1), which has been a source of daily motivation for many. I took this opportunity to showcase my creativity in user interface design and coding skills, aiming to create an engaging platform for users to take a momentary break and find motivation.

## Purpose

In today's world, many people are burdened by their own unique challenges and sufferings. Often, individuals feel isolated in their struggles, believing that their problems are uniquely insurmountable. However, it's important to realize that everyone faces difficulties, and it's the shared human experience that can help us find strength and solace.

**GainSomePositivity** serves two main purposes:
1. **Realization**: To help users understand that they are not alone in their struggles.
2. **Motivation**: To provide uplifting quotes that can help users take a deep breath, find a moment of peace, and rekindle their inner strength.

## Features

- **Endless Motivation**: The website runs motivational quotes in a loop. Users can let the quotes run and absorb the positivity.
- **Interactive Engagement**: When a user feels connected to a particular quote, they can click on it to receive more motivation, helping them through their current challenges.
- **User-Friendly
